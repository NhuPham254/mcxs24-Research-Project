# Introduction

The objective of this research project is to develop a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) model incorporating regime changes to analyze the dynamic relationships among macroeconomic variables, assess their impact on the unemployment rate over different economic regimes through time-varying parameters, and enhance forecasting accuracy.

The question to be addressed in this research is: Can a Bayesian VAR model with regime changes accurately capture shifts in the relationships between unemployment rate and other macroeconomic variables for improved forecasting performance?

# Motivation
Understanding the impact of economic regime changes on the unemployment rate dynamics holds substantial importance in grasping the complexities of the labour market. The labour market is highly susceptible to various shocks and policy interventions, making accurate forecasting of the unemployment rate crucial for informed decision-making. By employing a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) model that allows the parameters to vary across different economic regimes, we can gain a nuanced understanding of how the unemployment rate responds to diverse economic conditions and the efficacy of policies. This research enhances forecasting accuracy and offers valuable insights into the underlying drivers of unemployment fluctuations. By better understanding these dynamics, policymakers can make more informed decisions to counter economic instability.


# Data properties

For the investigation of the problem at hand, the selection of variables includes a comprehensive set of economic indicators and demographic factors that are crucial for understanding labour market dynamics and their impact on unemployment rates. 

For instance, GDP growth provides a broad measure of economic activity, serving as an indicator of overall labour market. Consumer price index, wage price index and interest rate reflect macroeconomic conditions and monetary policy, influencing consumer spending, business investment, and hiring decisions, thereby affecting unemployment trends. Government spending impacts aggregate demand and employment levels, while demographic factors such as population growth rate, average age of the workforce, and level of highest educational attainment offer insights into labour force participation and composition. 

Each variable's form/transformation will depend on its specific characteristics and the nature of its relationship with unemployment. For instance, variables like GDP growth may be included in their original form, while others, such as wpi might need to be computed from the index data. 

It's important to note that all data will be quarterly since the interest forecasting for unemployment will be conducted at a quarterly frequency. Quarterly frequency is suitable for capturing the diverse movements influencing unemployment, including short-term shocks, long-term trends, and policy changes, providing a balanced perspective.

From the plot of the variables, they all show non-stationary, which can make it challanging 
to analyse data. Therefore, the ACF test is performed to identify patterns and trend


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3, 4))

# Calculate ACF manually for each variable
acf_unmp <- acf(unmp$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_par <- acf(par_df$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_gdp <- acf(gdp$value, plot = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
acf_wpi <- acf(wpi$percentage_change, plot = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
acf_cpi <- acf(cpi$value, plot = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
acf_cashrate <- acf(cashrate_quarterly_df$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_hrs_full <- acf(hrs_full_df$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_hrs_part <- acf(hrs_part_pre$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_oversea <- acf(oversea$value, plot = TRUE)
acf_pop <- acf(pop$value, plot = TRUE, na.action = na.pass)
